 * Create a new instance of a PDO object using the MySQL driver.

 * Normally it's bad practice to have credentials stored in source code.
 * Environemnt variables or readonly files are a better place to put them.
 * 
 * I tried several solutions but unfortunately the apache account used to run
 * PHP can't access my files outside of public_html. At first I created a
 * file in my home directory with my username and password. Tried to chown 
 * it so the apache group could read from it but I guess student accounts aren't
 * allowed to do so.
 * 
 * The next best thing, I guess, would be to store the credentials in their
 * own PHP file but ignore it from source control.
